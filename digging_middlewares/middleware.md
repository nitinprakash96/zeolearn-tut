# Understanding Django Middlewares

This a very basic tutorial on Django-middlewares. We'll try to understand middlewares and write one of our own. The pre-requisite for thus tutorial is nothing but knowing the Django application structure and what are requests/responses.

## What are Middlewares?

The name sounds all fancy and stuff but it's quite straightforward if you think about it. We'll take an analogy and compare it with what it actually means and try to know it better.

According to [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/http/middleware/)
> Middleware is a framework of hooks into Django's request/response processing.
> It’s a light, low-level “plugin” system for globally altering Django’s input or output.

Let's consider a situation where you use 3 different kinds of softwares. For example, You use X for builds, Y for documenataion and Z for development purposes. But then you now want to integrate all of this into one big system to keep your software updated.

If you go ahead and start doing it manually, it may take a long period of time. But somehow you come up with a framework that reads the input/output of your resources and gives an overall correct output for an input.

In other words, the output generated by X can be used by Y and Z.
So basically, Middleware passes data between 2 or more applications.

Examples of operations perfromed by Middlewares:

- HTTP authentication
- Session management
- Encryption
- Validation
